Looks like changing user.name (git --global user.name "taleigh7") to my 
github username (not full name) allows me to push to "origin" so I don't 
have to use the full url in the push command anymore.

Test changing user.name from full name to taleigh7

README.txt file
This is the begining of a beautiful and educational endevour!

OBJECTIVE:
The Objective of this project is to serve as a work environment in 
which I can learn to work with git repositories. 


BACKGROUND:
A repository is a directory (folder) that contains all of the files 
associated with a single project.

Git is a tool that handles project version control. Git keeps track of 
each version of a project you create. 

By using the "commit" command, you let Git know that your want to 
save a file or the entire project as a version. 

Any further edits will be considered a part of the next version. 

You could potentially save the new version, and then return to a 
previously saved (committed) version.


Testing:
git commit -m "1st commit of index.html" index.html

Testing:
Change different line than uncommitted Master change to this file.
